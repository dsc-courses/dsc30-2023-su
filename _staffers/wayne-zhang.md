Hello! Iâ€™m Wayne and this is my second time TAing for DSC 30. I am a first/second year MSDS with an engineering focus on deep learning and large language model inference. I (try to) write code for fun in my spare time. I am generally a techno-optimist and enjoy talking about human and agents, alignment and amplification. My favorite movies are Blade Runner and 2049. (I also use Twitter 25h a day)
