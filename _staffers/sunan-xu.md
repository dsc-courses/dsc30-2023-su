Greetings! I'm Sunan, a student major in Bioinformatics and Data Science at Revelle College. My quest in the academic realm orbits around the fascinating world of DNA sequencing and computational chemistry, under the erudite guidance of Professor Francesco Paesani. When not delving into the genomic universe, you'd find me embarking on road trips, capturing life's vibrant hues through photography, or devising strategies in strategy games like Civilization.
