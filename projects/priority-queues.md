Online social media platforms facilitate the development of social relationships between users by allowing users to create and share content with each other. Most social media platforms rely on algorithms to personalize the content feed presented to each user. This user-generated content requires **moderation**, or methods for managing content shared between users on the platform.

In this project, we will compare 4 implementations of priority queues to simulate a content moderation queue that might be used in a social media platform where content is generated continuously. By the end of this project, students will be able to:

- **Design and implement** multiple data structures to solve complex problems.
- **Analyze and compare** implementation runtimes and interface affordances.

In the next project, we'll also use your priority queues as a building block for shortest paths.

Satisfactory completion of the project requires a **video-recorded team presentation that addresses all the green callouts** meeting the following requirements:

- **Each team member needs to present** part of the presentation in order to receive credit for the assignment.
- Your presentation should not be much longer than **7 minutes** and should **include your voiceover**. (Your video is appreciated but not necessary.)
- Your presentation should include some kind of **visually-organizing structure**, such as slides or a document.
- After submitting to Canvas, **add a submission comment** linking to your slides or document.

## Priority queue interface

The `MinPQ` interface represents a priority queue that affords access to minimum-priority elements. Priority values are extrinsic to each element: rather than relying on a `compareTo` method, priority values are specified as arguments to the `add` and `changePriority` methods.

`void add(E element, double priority)`
: Adds an element with the given priority value if the element is not already in this priority queue.

`boolean contains(E element)`
: Returns true if the given element is in this priority queue.

`E peekMin()`
: Returns the element with the minimum priority value.

`E removeMin()`
: Returns and removes an element with the minimum priority value.

`void changePriority(E element, double priority)`
: Updates the given element's associated priority value.

`int size()`
: Returns the number of elements in this priority queue.

The interface also defines two **default methods** that rely on implementations of the above methods.

`void addOrChangePriority(E element, double priority)`
: Adds an element with the given priority value if it is not already present. Otherwise, updates the priority value of the existing element.
: ```java
  if (!contains(element)) {
      add(element, priority);
  } else {
      changePriority(element, priority);
  }
  ```

`boolean isEmpty()`
: Returns true if this priority queue contains no elements. Returns whether `size() == 0`.

{: .hint }
A `MinPQ` cannot contain duplicate elements. However, different elements can have the same priority value. `peekMin` and `removeMin` may return any element with the minimum priority value.

Here's a small example showing how to use the `MinPQ` interface with the `DoubleMapMinPQ` class included in the project. Try it out for yourself by creating a new class in IntelliJ with the following code in the `main` method.

```java
MinPQ<String> pq = new DoubleMapMinPQ<>();
pq.add("1", 1.0);
pq.add("2", 2.0);
pq.add("3", 3.0);
pq.add("4", 4.0);
pq.add("5", 5.0);
pq.add("6", 6.0);

// Call methods to evaluate behavior.
pq.changePriority("3", 0.0);
pq.changePriority("1", 7.0);
while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
    System.out.println(pq.removeMin());
}
```

<summary>Why not just implement Java's PriorityQueue interface?</summary>

The `java.util` standard library includes a binary heap [`PriorityQueue`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/PriorityQueue.html) class. Here are three reasons why we can't implement Java's `PriorityQueue` class in this project.

`PriorityQueue` is a class
: We can't implement the `PriorityQueue` class because it's a _class_, not an _interface_. Although the Java developers designed `Set`, `Map`, and `List` as interfaces, priority queues are so commonly associated with binary heaps that the Java developers broke the pattern and defined `PriorityQueue` as a class.

`PriorityQueue` relies on `compareTo`
: By default, `PriorityQueue` uses elements' `compareTo` method to define the **priority** of an element. For example, the priority of the string "A" is less than "B" because "A" precedes "B" in the alphabet. This makes `PriorityQueue` great for sorting objects, but not great for applications like shortest paths.

`PriorityQueue` disaffords changing priority value
: The fact that `PriorityQueue` uses elements' `compareTo` methods reveals a hidden **disaffordance**. To change the priority of an object in `PriorityQueue`, we need to remove the element from the priority queue and then re-insert it. This workaround is not only inconvenient, but also inefficient and prone to bugs.

### PriorityNode

Java collections typically only specify a single data type as in `ArrayList<String>`. But a `MinPQ` needs to keep track of each element as well as its associated priority value. We could do this by creating two lists: an `ArrayList<T>` for elements and an `ArrayList<Double>` for each element's priority value. However, this approach requires us to ensure the state of both lists are always the same, which introduces additional complexity that makes the code harder to maintain and more brittle or susceptible to future bugs.

The `PriorityNode` class includes two fields representing an `element` together with its `priority` value so that it can be used in a Java collection.

```java
List<PriorityNode<String>> elements = new ArrayList<>();
elements.add(new PriorityNode<>("example", 0));
```

{: .hint }
Two `PriorityNode` objects are considered equal if and only if their elements are equal. Priority values are not checked for equality.

<details markdown="block">
<summary>How will this property of PriorityNode equality help you implement MinPQ?</summary>

`MinPQ` does not allow duplicate elements, but does allow duplicate priority values. When using Java collections such as a `List`, methods like `List.contains` or `List.remove` will call the objects' `equals` method to check for equality. The following `contains` call will return `true`, and the `remove` call will successfully remove the priority node even though their priority values are different.

```java
elements.contains(new PriorityNode<>("example", 1));
elements.remove(new PriorityNode<>("example", 2));
```
</details>

### Reference implementation

The project code includes a working `DoubleMapMinPQ`. This implementation is called "double map" because it combines the runtime benefits of two maps to solve the problem efficiently. The two maps work together to help achieve **sublinear** (logarithmic or better) runtime for every operation.

`TreeMap`
: Associates each unique priority value to all the elements with that priority value. Returning a minimum-priority element involves finding the set of minimum-priority elements and picking any element from that set.

`HashMap`
: Associates each element with its priority value in order to speed-up `contains` and `changePriority`.

The state of both maps is synchronized across all methods. Any change to one data structure also requires a change to the other data structure.

## Design and implement

Design and implement 3 implementations of the `MinPQ` interface.

{: .warning }
All team members must work together and fully understand each implementation. Do not assign each implementation to individual team members. The implementations are described in order of increasing complexity so later implementations will require significantly more work.

### UnsortedArrayMinPQ

Elements are added to an `ArrayList` in any order. Most operations may need to scan over the entire list.

### HeapMinPQ

A standard binary heap priority queue that delegates all method calls to `java.util.PriorityQueue`. In other words, each `MinPQ` operation is implemented by calling the underlying `PriorityQueue`. This class contains only one field assigned to an instance of `PriorityQueue`.

{: .deliverable }
Explain the part of the `HeapMinPQ` class that you're most proud of programming.

### OptimizedHeapMinPQ

A optimized binary heap priority queue supported by a `HashMap` that associates each element with its array index to speed-up `contains` and `changePriority`. Use the [`MinPQ`](https://github.com/kevin-wayne/algs4/blob/master/src/main/java/edu/princeton/cs/algs4/MinPQ.java) class as a reference.

1. Identify methods in the reference class that are most similar to our interface.
1. Adapt the code to implement our interface. Make sure all tests pass before optimizing the code.
1. Optimize the code by adding a `HashMap` synchronized to the state of the elements in the array.

## Analyze and compare

### Affordance analysis

Sorting presumes that data can be ordered on a line. Priority queues rely on the same presumption, except that elements are ordered according to their priority values. In the provided `Moderator` class, messages are entered into an `MinPQ` with "toxicity" scores provided by the [Perspective API](https://perspectiveapi.com/), a machine learning algorithm designed to reduce toxicity online.

[Toxicity scores represent probabilities between 0 and 1](https://developers.perspectiveapi.com/s/about-the-api-training-data) for the predicted likelihood that a human would perceive the comment as "rude, disrespectful, unreasonable, or otherwise somewhat likely to make the user leave a discussion or give up on sharing their perspective."

> For example, a comment like "You are an idiot" may receive a probability score of 0.8 for attribute TOXICITY, indicating that 8 out of 10 people would perceive that comment as toxic.

{: .warning }
Toxicity values are negated before they are added to the `MinPQ`, so each call to `removeMin` will remove the message that is most likely to be toxic.

{: .deliverable }
Give an affordance analysis of `MinPQ` for content moderation when using toxicity scores as the priority value. Identify the affordances of `MinPQ`. Then, evaluate the affordances by applying the three value-sensitive design principles. Your final arguments may combine ideas from 2 or all 3 principles, so it's not necessary to present them separately.

### Asymptotic analysis

{: .deliverable }
Give a big-theta bound for the worst-case runtime of the `removeMin` and `changePriority` methods for each implementation, including `DoubleMapMinPQ`, with respect to *N*, the size of the priority queue. Explain the runtime of each implementation in a couple sentences while referencing the code.

For all array-backed data structures, ignore the time it would take to resize the array.

[`java.util.PriorityQueue`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/PriorityQueue.html) is implemented using an array-representation binary heap that

> provides O(log(n)) time for the enqueuing and dequeuing methods (`offer`, `poll`, `remove()` and `add`); linear time for the `remove(Object)` and `contains(Object)` methods; and constant time for the retrieval methods (`peek`, `element`, and `size`).

`HashSet` and `HashMap` are implemented using resizing separate-chaining hash tables where the number of buckets is always similar to the size. Assume that the hash function evenly distributes elements across the underlying array. The Java implementations include a further optimization.

Tree bucket optimization
: When the [size of a bucket exceeds 8 elements](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-jdk11/blob/19fb8f93c59dfd791f62d41f332db9e306bc1422/src/java.base/share/classes/java/util/HashMap.java#L143-L231), the separate chain is automatically converted from a linked list to a red-black tree.

{: .deliverable }
Explain the impact of tree bucket optimization assuming an even distribution of elements across the underlying array. Does the tree bucket optimization help, hurt, or not affect the asymptotic analysis given our assumptions?
