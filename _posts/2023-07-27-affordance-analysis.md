Affordance Analysis
Give an affordance analysis of MapGraph.getLocationsByPrefix in Triton Maps.
Identify the affordances of the method. Then, evaluate the affordances by applying the three value-sensitive design principles.



Then, give an affordance analysis of MapGraph.shortestPath in Triton Maps.
1

Critique
What assumptions does Triton Maps make about users’ potential interactions? Give a bullet-pointed list of assumptions in the next 3 to 5 minutes. Aim for 10 or more!
Consider assumptions about users’ prior knowledge, cultural context, language literacy, visual ability, hearing ability, motor ability, cognitive ability, and access to technology.
2

Imagine
Select one assumption that you think is important to address. Briefly describe in a few sentences a scenario where a user could not use the app as expected because of the assumption. This represents one way the design could exclude certain users.
3

Design
Brainstorm ways you can change the design to address the scenario you just wrote. Give a bullet-pointed list of potential solutions in the next 3 to 5 minutes. Aim for ten or more!
4

Expand
In Canvas, the reflector should submit the In-Class Team Critique: Triton Maps. Type-out at least 4 assumptions that you developed in the critique stage.
Afterwards, the presenter should share these critiques with another nearby team.
Finally, once you’ve heard another team’s critiques, reflect on what you learned. What did the other team’s critiques reveal about Triton Maps that you hadn’t initially considered?
