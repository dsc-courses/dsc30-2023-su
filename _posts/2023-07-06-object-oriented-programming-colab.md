We can also express this same computation as an object-oriented program by defining a class and creating a new instance for each account. In **object-oriented programming** (OOP), methods are bundled together or **encapsulated** with data to form an abstraction.

"""Although this call to `sorted` produces a valid result, it violates the principle of abstraction. **Abstractions** are designed to hide all internal implementation details from clients. Clients should not directly access (or, worse, modify!) a data field stored within an object.

In the case of a simple "data class" like `Balance`, it's not clear why this absolutist approach to abstraction is necessary. But, as our implementations grow more complex, it's recommended to use methods to manage access to any data in an object.

"""In Java, object-oriented programming is about defining classes that implement interfaces. These interfaces serve as a "contract" between different parts of a program. These contracts can stretch across time and space: one of the inventors of Java implemented `Arrays.sort` several decades ago, and even today I can use that function so long as my code follows the `Comparable` contract."""
